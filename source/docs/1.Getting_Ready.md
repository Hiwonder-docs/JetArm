<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image29.png"  />

## 1.3 Initial Startup Instructions

In this section, we will learn about the robot's power-on status and the functionality checks for each module. After this, you can proceed to the subsequent chapters to learn about controlling the robot using a mobile app and a game controller.

If you need to connect remote tools to the robot for further exploration of its features and to view the programming, please refer to the content under the section [1.6 Development Environment Setup and Configuration]().

### 1.3.1 Note

The Jetson Orin Nano and Jetson Orin NX boards use a dual power supply system. Please strictly follow the steps below:

(1) Firstly, connect the 19V/2.37A power adapter to the main board.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image31.png"   />

(2) Then, connect the 12V/5A power adapter to the STM32 control board.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image32.png"   />

Following this order ensures that all hardware components of the robotic arm operate correctly.

(1) Do not position the robot near the edge of a high surface to prevent it from falling and causing damage.

(2) Whenever possible, place the robot on a flat surface during operation.

(3) Avoid stacking the robotic arm to prevent it from stalling when powered on, which could damage the servos.

<table  class="docutils-nobg" style="margin:0 auto" border="1">
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image33.jpeg"  width="280px"></td>
        <td><img src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image34.jpeg" width="280px"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image35.png" width="140px"></td>
        <td><img src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image36.png"  width="140px"></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

(4) Do not keep the robotic arm under heavy load for extended periods, as this may shorten the lifespan of the servos or cause direct damage.

(5) Maintain a safe distance from the robot before starting it to avoid any injury from accidental contact once it is powered on.

(6) Before conducting any checks, ensure that the wiring is correct, the controller receiver is properly connected, the sound is enabled in the top right corner of the desktop, and the robot is fully charged.

### 1.3.2 Power-On Status Description 

(1) Turn ON the switch on driver.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image37.png"  />

(2) After 25 to 35 seconds, the blue LED light on the expansion board (LED1) will illuminate and continue to blink. At this point, only the network configuration service is active, while the ROS system and other services have not yet fully started. Wait for a short beep from the buzzer, indicating that the ROS configuration is complete and the device has fully started.

The LED lights for the **Jetson Nano, Jetson Orin Nano, and Jetson Orin NX** versions are located as shown below:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image38.png"  />

(1) Robot is in AP direct connection mode by default. After the robot is powered up, it will generate a WIFI starting with “HW” with an initial password of “**hiwonder**” for app connection and remote desktop system connection.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image39.png"  />

:::{Note}

If you cannot find the device hotspot after powering on, please follow these troubleshooting steps:

* Check according to the instructions in section “[1.3.2 Power-On Status Description]()”.

* If the LED1 on the expansion board is a steady blue light, it may be set to local area network mode. Long press the key1 button on the expansion board for 5 to 10 seconds. If LED1 starts blinking, a Wi-Fi network starting with HW will be generated.

* If LED1 does not blink after long pressing key1, it may indicate that the SD card or SSD is not detected. Please try reinserting the SD card or SSD.

* If the LED remains steady after reinserting, there may be an issue with the SD card or SSD, or users who purchased a package without a controller may not have burned the image. It is recommended to replace the SD card or SSD or re-burn the image.

* If you still cannot power on after replacing the SD card or SSD and re-burning the image, there may be an issue with the Jetson mainboard. Please contact customer service for further assistance.

## 1.5 Color Threshold Setting

When we playing the AI vision games, the environment light will affect the JetArm’s performance. And we can adjust the color threshold to cope with this. Take Android system as example for demonstration. It is also applicable to iOS system.

(1) Start JetArm and connect it to “**WonderAi**”. (For the operation instruction, please refer to [1.3 Initial Startup Instructions]()” and [1.4 App Control]().)

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image50.png"   />

(2) Enter the main interface, then click “<img  src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image111.png"   />” at the upper right corner to enter the interface of color threshold setting.

(3) Take adjusting red color for example. Place the red block within the recognition area on the map, then select the red icon.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image112.png"   />

(4) Click “**Instruction**” button to check the color adjustment instruction.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image113.png"   />

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image114.png"   />

(5) Set the parameters of **L_min, a_min and b_min** as 0, and the parameters of **L_max, a_max and b_max** as 255.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image115.png"  />

(6) Refer to LAB color space distribution to adjust the L, A and B components.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image116.png"   />

(7) According to the Lab color model diagram, red color is around “**+a**” zone, so we need to adjust the color threshold to “**+a**” zone. Keep the values of “L**\_max**” unchanged, while increase the values of “L**\_min**” until the block image in the screen turns white and other area turns black.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image117.png"   />

(8) Then based on the environment, adjust the value of **L_min, L_max, b_min and b_max.** If the color belongs to light red, you need to increase the value of “**L_min**”. If it belongs to dark red, decrease the value of “**L_max**”. If it belongs to dark red, decrease the value of “**L_max**”. If it belongs to warm tone, increase the value of “**b_min**”. If it belongs to cool tone, decrease the value of “**b_max**”

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image117.png"   />

(9) After the adjustment is completed, tap the **“Save”** button to save the color threshold.

## 1.6 Development Environment Setup and Configuration

### 1.6.1 Remote Control Tool Introduction and Installation

NoMachine is a graphical remote control software. Once installed, you can connect to the robot's hotspot and control it directly from your computer. The Jetson Nano, Jetson Orin Nano, and Jetson Orin NX main controllers all use NoMachine for connectivity. With this software, users can clearly see the robot's system desktop, making it easier for intuitive operation.

In contrast, MobaXterm is designed for SSH connections and focuses more on command line control. It does not display the complete desktop of the robot’s system; instead, it provides only a command line window. For users who are proficient with command line operations, this allows for faster control of the robot while reducing computational load and memory usage.

MobaXterm includes a lightweight X11 server that can directly display the interfaces of graphical applications. It is compatible with any main controller you are using.

In summary, NoMachine is suitable for scenarios that require intuitive operation, while MobaXterm is better for quickly executing commands. Choose the appropriate software for remote control based on your specific needs.

Before you start, if you are using a desktop computer, please ensure that you have a wireless network card that supports the 5GHz frequency band.

(1) Right-click “**This computer**” to choose “**Manage**”.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image172.png"   />

(2) Click on “**Device Manager”** in the left-hand menu of the interface. Locate the “**NDIS driver**” under “**Network adapters**” and right-click on the driver. Choose the “**Update driver**” option from the menu.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image173.png"   />

(3) After the installation of driver, refer to **Section 5.2.1 or 5.2.2** to login the system. In addition, you need to replace the IP address with 192.168.55.1.

### 1.6.6 Introduction to the System Command Line Terminal

In the following course chapters, it is essential to pay attention to the ROS version corresponding to the command line terminal. If an incompatible terminal is opened, inputting commands will result in errors. For example, commands intended for ROS1 will not work in a ROS2 terminal.

* **Jetson Nano Version**

This command line terminal <img   src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image174.png"  /> is configured with the ROS1 environment.

* **Jetson Orin Nano Version**

This command-line terminal <img src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image175.png"  /> is configured with the ROS1 environment, while the terminal <img  src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image176.png"  /> is configured with the ROS2 environment.

* **Jetson Orin NX Version**

This command-line terminal <img   src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image175.png"  /> is configured with the ROS1 environment, while the terminal <img  src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image176.png"  /> is configured with the ROS2 environment.

### 1.6.7 Robot Version Configuration Tool Guide

This section introduces the built-in Version Configuration Tool, which allows switching between different chassis types, various radar and camera models, and English or Chinese voice options.

This content is primarily intended for the following users:

(1) Those who purchased a version without a controller

(2) Those who have re-flashed the system image

(3) Those who have replaced compatible components, such as switching from a Mecanum wheel chassis to a tracked chassis

For users who purchased a complete system with a controller included, this section is for reference only, and no action is required. Before using the tool, confirm the system version configuration based on the main control model you have purchased.

* **Introduction and Use of the Tool**

(1) Use the NoMachine remote desktop tool to connect to the robot. For specific connection steps, please refer to the guide.

(2) In the remote desktop, double-click <img  src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image177.png"  /> to open the Robot System Configuration Tool.

(3) As shown below, basic users should select:

Robot Type: JetArm Starter

Camera Type: USB WebCam

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image178.png"  />

For Standard, Advanced, and Ultimate users, select:

Robot Type: JetArm Advanced

Camera Type: Gemini

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image179.png"  />

(4) Users can check their order information to verify their hardware version. Generally, you only need to configure the Robot Type, Camera Type, and Language settings as shown in the table below. Leave other options at their default settings to avoid potential issues.

<table  class="docutils-nobg" style="margin:0 auto" border="1">
<colgroup>
<col  />
<col  />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Option</strong></td>
<td><strong>Configuration</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Machine type</td>
<td>JetArm Starter<br />
JetArm Advanced</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Camera type</td>
<td>USB WebCam<br />
Gemini</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Language</td>
<td>Chinese/English</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


(5) For example, if we need to switch the robot type from JetArm Starter to JetArm Advanced:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image180.png"  />

(6) Click Apply & Save followed by Restart Play Service in that order to ensure the robot type is successfully updated.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image181.png"  />

(7) Once the robot’s buzzer beeps, the switch has been successful. You can then open the terminal interface according to your main control version to confirm the changes.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image182.png"  />

* **Verifying Configuration Changes**

The following demonstrates how to verify changes on the three controller types: **Jetson Nano, Jetson Orin Nano, and Jetson Orin NX.** For details on terminal differences, refer to the "Introduction to the System Command Line Terminal.

(1) Jetson Nano Controller Version

Click <img  src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image183.png"  /> to initiate the ROS1 command-line terminal to check.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image184.png"  />

(2) Jetson Orin Nano/Jetson Orin NX Version

Open the command line terminal <img src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image183.png"  /> to verify the configuration.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image185.png"  />

### 1.6.8 Remote Desktop Resolution Settings

If the package includes a 7-inch touchscreen display or a monitor, using remote connection tools may result in low or blurry screen resolution. We can follow the steps below to adjust the remote desktop resolution, typically setting it to 1920x1080.

:::{Note}

For the Jetson Nano version, make sure to disconnect the HDMI cable from the screen before powering on to ensure the desktop resolution syncs properly.

:::

* **Jetson Orin Nano Version**

After connecting via NoMachine, follow these steps to set up the resolution (you will need to repeat these settings for subsequent connections):

(1) On the first boot, the resolution may appear abnormal. Click the top left corner <img  src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image186.png"  /> to manually adjust the resolution.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image137.png"  />

(2) Then, click the top right corner <img  src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image187.png"  /> to close this page, and click the connection icon again to re-enter.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image188.png"  />

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image189.png"  />

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image40.png"  />

## 1.7 Wireless Handle Control

### 1.7.1 Preparation

(1) Insert the handle receiver into any USB interface on Jetson Nano. Before powering on the device, please ensure that the controller receiver is inserted. If it is already inserted, you can ignore this step (the USB controller receiver is pre-inserted at the factory).

(2) Please bring your own two AAA dry batteries. And insert them into the battery slot. And do not invert the positive and negative poles.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image190.png"   />

(3) Each time the robot powers on, the app auto-start service (which includes controller functionality) will launch automatically. If it hasn’t been turned off, no further action is needed—just connect and control directly.

(4) As controller signals may interfere with each other, it is recommended not to use this feature if multiple robots are in the same area to avoid unintentional connections or control.

(5) After turning on the controller, it will enter sleep mode if it doesn’t connect to the robot within 30 seconds or if left unused for 5 minutes after connecting. To wake the controller from sleep mode, press the "START" button.

### 1.7.2 Device Connection 

(1) Start JetArm. Switch on handle. At this point, two LEDs (red and green) on the handles will flash simultaneously.

(2) Please wait for a while. Then the robot will pair with the handle automatically. After successful pairing, the green light will keep lighting up and red LED light goes out.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image191.png"  />

### 1.7.3 Control Mode Introduction

The handle control for the robotic arm are divided into two modes: coordinate mode and single servo mode. When the handle is successfully connected, it defaults to the coordinate mode.

**Single servo mode**: by pressing the buttons on handle, you can control individual servos on the robotic arm for forward and reverse movements. **Coordinate mode**: by pressing the buttons on handle, you can control the robotic arm as a whole along the trajectory of three axes (X, Y, Z) and combined with angular deviation for motion.

The way to switch between the two modes: press the **“SELECT”** and **“START”** buttons. Once you hear a beep sound, the mode has been successfully switched. Switching from single servo mode to coordinate mode, you will be prompted through two beeps sound. One beep sound represents the switch from coordinate mode to single servo mode.

### 1.7.4 Button Function

* **Single Servo Mode**

Following is the button function instruction for single servo mode:

|  **Button**  | **Function (from the first-person perspective of robotic arm)** |
| :----------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
|    START     |        Return the robotic arm to its initial posture         |

|      L2      |                       Lower servo No.3                       |
|      R1      |                       Raise servo No.4                       |
|      R2      |                       Lower servo No.4                       |

## 1.8 Position Adjustment for Object Gripping and Placing

:::{Note}

* Once the parameters adjusted take effect, the gripping and placing effects of color sorting, tag sorting, intelligent stacking (it can only be executed via app), and waste sorting.

* Prior to shipment, the robotic arm has undergone calibration. However, discrepancies between the calibration environment and the actual usage environment, coupled with potential vibrations during transport, may result in suboptimal execution of sorting, stacking, and other games, causing the gripper to inaccurately pick up and place blocks.

* In the event of the aforementioned issues, refer to the following instructions to adjust the gripping and placing positions of the robotic arm.

  :::

### 1.8.1 Preparation

(1) Place and start the robotic arm on map. Connect it on app according to [1.4.1 App Installation]().

(2) Adjust the color threshold according to [1.5 Color Threshold Setting]().

(3) Check whether the robotic arm has deviation. If there is a deviation, please adjust according to “4. Deviation Adjustment”.

(4) Calibrate the position according to [1.4.5 Position Calibration]().

(5) Re-start the robot sorting or stacking games to check if there is any deviation during gripping and placing. If there is any deviation, then refer to the following instructions for adjustments (you may skip this section if the gripping and placing effects are good).

### 1.8.2 Position Adjustment Tool

* **Introduction to the Position Adjustment Tool**

(1) Refer to [1.6 Development Environment Setup and Configuration]() to remotely connect the device to the system desktop.

(2) For the Jetson Nano version, click the system desktop icon <img  src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image192.png"  /> to open the JetArm Position Calibration Tool. For the Jetson Orin Nano or Jetson Orin NX versions, click the system desktop icon <img  src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image193.png"  /> to open the JetArm Position Calibration Tool.

:::{Note}

The positive direction of the X-axis is the front of the robotic arm, the positive direction of the Y-axis is to the left of the arm, and the positive direction of the Z-axis is above the arm.

:::

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image194.png"   />

The offset unit is in meters. For example, increasing the X-axis value by 0.01 shifts the grasping position of the arm forward by 1 cm.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image195.png"   />

The parameters are defined as follows:

The target positions for activities such as color sorting, label sorting, smart stacking, and waste classification are illustrated in the diagram below:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image198.png"   />

* **Grasping Position Adjustment**

(1) Open the position adjustment tool. Here, we will use the grasping position for color sorting as an example; other grasping-related activities will follow the same adjustment method.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image195.png"   />

(2) If we need to adjust the grasping position, we must modify the offset values for "**Positioning X, Y, Z**."

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image199.png"  />

(3) Before starting the adjustment, open the color sorting feature in the app, place the colored blocks in the grasping area, and observe the offset when the gripper grasps the colored block.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image92.png"   />

(4) For this example, we will consider the scenario where the gripper is positioned in front of the colored block; the same adjustment method applies to other situations.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image200.png"   />

(5) If the gripper is offset forward when grasping, reduce the Positioning X offset value by 0.01. Click **Apply** -\> **Save** (the offset unit is in meters; reducing by 0.01 m means that when the claw grasps again, it will shift down by 1 cm. Adjustments should be made based on the actual situation, either increasing or decreasing the offset value by 0.01 or 0.001).

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image195.png"   />

(6) Return to the mobile app's mode selection screen and wait for the robotic arm to start grasping. Check the adjustment effect (the effect takes effect in real-time; after clicking the **Apply** button, it will take effect during the next grasping action without needing to re-enter the activity).

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image201.png"   />

(7) If the colored block is still not grasped or there are deviations in the Y or Z axes, follow steps 3-7 to adjust the corresponding offset values.

(8) If the wooden block is at the edge of the grasping area and the gripper's grasping position is offset inconsistently, we can adjust the scaling values for "Positioning X, Y, Z."

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image202.png"  />

(9) Before starting the adjustment, open the color sorting feature in the mobile app, place the colored block at the edge of the grasping area, and observe the offset when the gripper grasps the colored block.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image203.png"  />

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image204.png"  />

(10) You may find that when the wooden block is at the left edge of the grasping area, the gripper tends to offset slightly to the right when grasping; conversely, when the block is at the right edge, the gripper tends to offset slightly to the left. In this case, you need to increase the Positioning X scaling value to 1.10 (after adjusting the scaling value to 1.10, the original position of 0.1 will change to 0.1 \* 1.10 = 0.11, meaning that during the next grasping action, the gripper will offset by 1 cm towards the edge. Adjustments should be made based on the actual situation, either increasing or decreasing the scaling value by 0.01 or 0.1). Click Apply -\> Save. The same adjustment method applies to other situations.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image205.png"   /><img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image206.png"   />

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image207.png"  />

(11) Return to the mobile app's mode selection screen, wait for the robotic arm to start grasping, and check the adjustment effect (the effect takes effect in real-time; after clicking the **Apply** button, it will take effect during the next grasping action without needing to re-enter the activity).

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image201.png"   />

(12) If there are still deviations while grasping in the edge area, follow steps 9-11 to adjust the corresponding scaling values.

* **Placement Position Adjustment**

The method for adjusting the placement position is consistent with that of the grasping position. It is important to pay attention to the target placement position.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image198.png"   />

(1) Here, we will take the example of adjusting the X-axis coordinate to move forward and the Y-axis coordinate to move left while sorting red objects.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image208.png"   />

(2) In this case, it is necessary to decrease the X and Y-axis coordinates of Target 1. For preliminary adjustments, reduce the values by increments of 0.01. If a larger adjustment was made, fine-tuning can also be done using increments of 0.005. Users should modify the values based on specific situations.

(3) Once adjustments are complete, click **Apply -\> Save.**

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image209.png"  />

(4) Return to the mobile app's mode selection screen, re-enter the color sorting feature, and check the adjustment effect.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image210.png"   />

## 1.9 Hardware Introduction

This chapter will mainly introduce the hardware components of ROS robots, including the electrical control system, ROS main control unit, depth camera and various sensors.

### 1.9.1 Hardware System 

The robotic electrical control system utilizes an STM32 controller as the core motion controller to enable communication between the Jetson controller and the bus servos. The specific models and connection methods for the ROS controller vary and will be explained in detail below.

- **Jetson Nano Version**

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image211.png"  />

- **Jetson Orin Nano/Jetson Orin NX Version**

  <img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image212.png"  />

### 1.9.2 Electrical Control System Introduction

* **STM32 Controller**

The STM32 open-source controller is specially designed for robot development, small and exquisite.

The controller deploys STM32F407VET6 as the main control, utilizing Arm’s Cortex-M4 core, running at 168MHz. It has an onboard FLASH capacity of 512K, an SRAM capacity of 192K, and integrates FPU and DSP instructions.

The STM32F40x/41x series system block diagram is shown below:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image213.jpeg"   />

With ample onboard resources and extension port, the controller is highly suitable for ROS robot development. It can be seamlessly integrated with the Jetson series ROS main control to make a ROS-based robot.

**The resources and peripherals of STM32F407VET6 processor is shown as in the table below.**

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image215.png"  />

* **STM32 Carrier Board**

The STM32 carrier board provides power to the robotic arm hardware, connects the bus servos, and controls the rotation of the servos. For additional information on the expansion board and the STM32 main controller, please refer to '4. Hardware Information\2. STM32 Controller Information.' The resource configuration on the front of the carrier board is displayed in the image below:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image216.png"   />

* **Power Instruction**

(1) Jetson Nano Controller

The Jetson Nano main controller operates using a 12V 5A adapter (DC 4.0mm). The 12V input powers the STM32 controller, which directly supplies power to the bus servos. A DC-DC converter then steps down the voltage to 5V to power the Jetson Nano, with a maximum current output of 5A.

(2) Jetson Orin Nano & Jetson Orin NX Controller

These two main controllers use a dual power supply scheme. A 12V 5A adapter (DC 4.0mm) connects to the STM32 controller, directly powering the bus servos. Meanwhile, a 19V 2.37A adapter (DC 5.5mm) supplies power directly to the Jetson Orin Nano and Jetson Orin NX main controllers.

### 1.9.3 ROS Controller

The JetArm robot provides comprehensive support for ROS main controllers. The usage methods for each controller are similar, as they all run on the Ubuntu system. Below is a comparison of the specifications for the Jetson Nano, Jetson Orin Nano, and Jetson Orin NX main controllers:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image217.png"   />

* **Jetson Nano Version**

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image218.png"   />

The Jetson Nano version comprises a Jetson Nano controller and a Jetson expansion board. The controller is a compact yet powerful computer capable of running popular deep learning frameworks, providing the computational power required for most artificial intelligence projects.

The expansion board features LED indicators and buttons, enabling users to monitor network status through LED blinking and switch network modes with the buttons. It also includes reserved GPIO and I2C interfaces.

The controller operates on Ubuntu 18.04 and is configured with the ROS Melodic environment for robotics. For foundational courses on ROS main controllers, please refer to “ROS Main Controller Tutorial.”

* **Jetson Orin Nano Version**

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image219.png"  />

The Jetson Orin Nano version consists of a Jetson Orin Nano controller and a Jetson expansion board. Compared to the Jetson Nano, the Jetson Orin Nano offers significantly faster processing speeds and improved memory read/write performance, with an overall performance boost of 40-80 times.

The expansion board includes LED indicators and buttons, allowing users to check network status through LED blinking and switch network modes via the buttons. It also provides reserved GPIO and I2C interfaces.

The controller runs on Ubuntu 20.04 and is set up with the ROS1 Noetic environment for robotics. For basic courses on ROS main controllers, please refer to "ROS Controller Course.”

* **Jetson Orin NX Version**

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image219.png"  />

The Jetson Orin NX is offered in 8GB and 16GB versions, comprising the Jetson Orin NX controller and an expansion board. The Jetson Orin NX 16GB significantly outperforms the Jetson Orin Nano 4GB, delivering faster computation speeds, enhanced memory read/write rates, and up to 5 times the performance.

The expansion board is equipped with LEDs and buttons for user convenience, allowing users to monitor network status through LED indicators and switch network modes with a button. It also includes GPIO and I2C interfaces.

### 1.9.5 Vision Module

* **Depth Camera**

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image223.png"  />

The camera is one of the most important components in the robot's structure, analogous to human eyes.

This robot features the Orbbec Gemini embedded 3D camera module, which can capture both depth and color images. It offers advantages of compact size and high performance, making it suitable for 3D object scanning at recognition distances ranging from 25 to 250 cm, and it supports a USB 3.0 interface.

With its active stereo structured light design, the Gemini provides high-resolution depth maps and infrared image data, along with strong light resistance.

* **Monocular Camera**

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image224.png"  />

The main difference between a monocular camera and a depth camera is that the monocular camera cannot capture depth information. As a result, applications that rely on depth perception cannot be directly implemented with a monocular camera, including RGB data visualization, point cloud data visualization, KCF object tracking, human body tracking, RTAB-Map 3D mapping, 3D depth visual recognition and tracking, 3D spatial object grasping, and voice-controlled color sorting.

### 1.9.6 Others

* **Microphone Array Module**

This module is an optional hardware component that enables voice wake-up and voice control functions on the robot. For courses related to the microphone array module.

The robot is equipped with a 6-channel microphone array arranged in a planar distribution, consisting of six microphones. This system samples and processes the spatial characteristics of the sound field, allowing for sound source localization and 360° equivalent sound pickup. See the illustration below:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image225.png"  />

The noise reduction board can suppress background noise, interference, reverberation, and echoes, as illustrated below:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image226.png"   />

* **Sound Card and Speaker**

The sound card and speaker are used for audio notifications. When paired with the 6-channel microphone array module, they enable voice interaction with the robot.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image227.png"  />

* **7-Inch LCD Screen**

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image228.png"  />

**(The system desktop is for your reference only. Please** **subject to the actual situation)**

The 7-inch LCD display features both display and touchscreen functions. In addition to viewing the robot's system desktop directly, users can quickly experience mapping and navigation features by tapping on icons on the desktop.

9.6.4 PS2 Wireless Handle

(2) For example, to access the OpenCV examples, enter the following commands:

```
cd opencv
```

```
ls
```

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image246.png"  />

In this directory, the .launch.py files are the launch files for various OpenCV examples.

(3) Next, enter the following commands to navigate to the source code directory.

```
cd include
```

```
ls
```

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image247.png"  />

(4) This directory contains the source code files for the corresponding OpenCV examples.

(5) Before starting an example, you must disable the app's auto-start service (refer to Section 3.1 Disabling and Enabling Auto-Start Services). Then:Navigate to the directory containing the example's launch file and run:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_1/media/image248.png"  />

Alternatively, you can start the example from any directory by specifying the package name and file name:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1\section_1/media/image249.png"  />
